# GraphCut-ImageSegmentation
In this repo , we apply graph cut for image segmentation. We will consider the **binary case** where we segment foreground and background pixels, and the **multi-label** case. 

This project is done by the students Ghassen Bettaieb , Mohamed Amine Hachicha and Hamza Gharbi , for the MVA course Graphical Models Discrete Inference and Learning.
